```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```{r}

### Mark some vectors

```{r}
marmots <-c("blue", "green", 4, "yellow")
#Check the class, please tell me what is the class of marmots
class(marmots)
```

```{r}
pika <-c(12.4, 6.8, 2.9, 8.8, 8.5)
class(pika)

# Scalar multiplier
# need to be deliberate about what we store

scalar_pika <-5.2 * pika

scalar_pika
```

```{r}
bananas <- c(1, 2, 3)
apples <-c(6, 7, 8)

bananas + apples
bananas - apples

bananas %*% apples

# dot product needs function to be together %*% 
```
